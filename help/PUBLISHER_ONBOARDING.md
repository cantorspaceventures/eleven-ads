## 🤝 Step 3: Managing Deals & Revenue

### Direct Deals
*   Advertisers may send you **Direct Offers** for specific inventory.
*   Go to the **"Deals"** tab to view pending offers.
*   **Actions:**
    *   ✅ **Accept:** Immediately activates the deal.
    *   ❌ **Reject:** Declines the offer.
    *   💬 **Negotiate:** Propose a new price.

### Real-Time Bidding (RTB)
*   If your inventory is "Digital" (DOOH, App, Web), it is automatically enrolled in our **RTB Exchange**.
*   **How it works:**
    *   When a slot opens, we broadcast a request to Advertisers.
    *   The highest bidder wins instantly.
    *   You earn revenue automatically based on the clearing price.

### Dashboard Analytics
*   **Total Revenue:** Track your earnings month-to-date.
*   **Fill Rate:** See what % of your inventory is sold.
*   **Active Units:** Monitor live assets.
